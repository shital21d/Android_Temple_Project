Title: Guru Mandir

Description: The app allows users to donate remotely, contribute to rituals, get real-time updates on temple status. The application is designed to provide convenience and enhance the overall experience of devotees. For developing this application, I used Android Studio, with Java for the sever-side implementation and XML for the user interface. For the database management, I used phpMyAdmin to efficiently handle and manage the data. To ensure seamless communication between the app and the database, I implemented web services using PHP. This setup allows the application to interact with the database effectively, to enable features provided by the application.

Technologies used: Android, Java, Xml, MySQL, Php.

Tools: Android Studio, Xampp, Postman, phpMyAdmin.
